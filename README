=== GRAMMAR ===

The only special character classes implemented are \d (digits) and \s (spaces and tabs).

Grr's regex engine does not support group capturing and so all text within parentheses are considered a
non-capturing group.

Braces (i.e., { and }) can only be used to specify an exact quantity.

A lookahead character class can be added to a regex with a forward slash.  For example, if the regex is
"a+/[0-9]", then, when calling grrSearch and grrFirstMatch, a string of "a"'s will not be considered a match
unless the following character is a digit.
