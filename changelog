2.0.2:
    - Parenthetical groups without any disjunction operators are now recognized properly.
    - grrMatch no longer fails when the final character moves the NFA into the accepting state.

2.0.1:
    - Fixed an infinite loop issue.
    - The '$' symbol wasn't being properly recognized.
    - The '.' symbol wasn't being properly recognized.

2.0.0:
    - grrMatch can no longer return GRR_RET_OUT_OF_MEMORY.
    - grrMatch now ignores the ^ and $ regex special characters.
    - grrNfa objects no longer maintain their own scratch pads.  Instead, the scratch pads are allocated on
      the stack as needed.  This caused a small but noticeable speed-up in runtime.
    - A look-ahead character class can now added to the end of regexes.
