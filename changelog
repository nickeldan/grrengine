2.0.0:
    - grrMatch can no longer return GRR_RET_OUT_OF_MEMORY.
    - grrMatch now ignores the ^ and $ regex special characters.
    - grrNfa objects no longer maintain their own scratch pads.  Instead, the scratch pads are allocated on
      the stack as needed.  This caused a small but noticeable speed-up in runtime.
    - A look-ahead character class can now added to the end of regexes.
    - The grrFirstMatch function was added.
